# Task-2---Supervised-ML
I got an amazing opportunity to work with The Spark Foundation as Data Science and Analytics Intern. I have been given number of task to perform. Hence, I am uploading my Task#2 which is performing Regression.
I will be uploading more of my work here.
The learning is great. 
Most Importantly from this very task I learned how to predict a specific value when a user enter some value, in this case I am asking the user to input no. of hours he/she studied in a day and the scores is predicted. It was really amazing!!!
I am really enjoying!!
